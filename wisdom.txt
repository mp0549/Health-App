cd       # takes you to your home directory
ls -l    # long form list
ll       # is al alias of ls -l probably
alias ll # will tell you what it is
alias    # lists your current aliases

# you CAN absolutely add new aliases for yourself

# In bash (Bourne Again Shell) ~ means two different things
1. ~/ means your home directory
2. ~x means home directory of user x
--> that means ~om/.bashrc means .bashrc file in the home directory of om

Most of time, home directory of a user is /home/username
I say most of time, because it is configurable.

Let's add a few new aliases to your list. We will edit ~/.bashrc file to do that.
I'll explain later why we edit that file.

# Add these two lines to the bottom of ~/.bashrc

alias glog='git log --all --graph --pretty=format:'\''%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset'\'' --abbrev-commit --date=relative'
alias gs='git status -s'

# Rudimentary vi survival tips

vi a.txt # start editing a.txt
# vi as three modes, browse mode, edit mode, and command mode
# everything happens through the alphabetic keys,
# for example  HJKL   left down up right

Display line numbers on the left
:set number,  :set nu, :set nonu
This is a command mode thing, starts with colon

edit mode is when you wand to add or delete text
they are all mostly single keystrokes while in browse mode

once you are in edit mode, hit esc to get back to browse mode

o # add a line below
O # above

G # go to the bottom of the file
o # trying to add new lines

alias glog='git log --all --graph --pretty=format:'\''%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset'\'' --abbrev-commit --date=relative'
alias gs='git status -s'

esc # to get back to browse mode

We need to write the file to disc, which is a command
:w

We need to exit out of vi. A command
:q
